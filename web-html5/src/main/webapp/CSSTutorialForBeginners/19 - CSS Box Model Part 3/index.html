<p class="para4">HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web. It was
    finalized, and published, on 28 October 2014[2] by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).[3] This is the fifth
    revision of the HTML standard since the inception of the World Wide Web. The previous version, HTML 4, was
    standardized in 1997.Its core aims are to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia while keeping
    it easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and devices (web browsers, parsers, etc.).
    HTML5 is intended to subsume not only HTML 4, but also XHTML 1 and DOM Level 2 HTML.Following its immediate
    predecessors HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.1, HTML5 is a response to the fact that the HTML and XHTML in common use on the
    World Wide Web have a mixture of features introduced by various specifications, along with those introduced by
    software products such as web browsers and those established by common practice.[5] It is also an attempt to define
    a single markup language that can be written in either HTML or XHTML. It includes detailed processing models to
    encourage more interoperable implementations; it extends, improves and rationalizes the markup available for
    documents, and introduces markup and application programming interfaces (APIs) for complex web applications.[6] For
    the same reasons, HTML5 is also a potential candidate for cross-platform mobile applications. Many features of HTML5
    have been built with the consideration of being able to run on low-powered devices such as smartphones and tablets.
    In December 2011, research firm Strategy Analytics forecast sales of HTML5 compatible phones would top 1 billion in
    2013.[7]</p>
