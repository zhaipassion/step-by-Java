In this showcase you'll see the following in action:

* The simplest possible @Controller
* Mapping Requests
* Obtaining Request Data
* Generating Responses
* Message Converters
* Rendering Views
* Type Conversion
* Validation

    $ git clone git://github.com/SpringSource/spring-mvc-showcase.git

To run the application:
-------------------	
From the command line with Maven:

    $ cd spring-mvc-showcase
    $ mvn tomcat7:run [-Dmaven.tomcat.port=<port no.>] (In case 8080 is busy] 

or

In your preferred IDE such as SpringSource Tool Suite (STS) or IDEA:

* Import spring-mvc-showcase as a Maven Project

This showcase originated from a [blog post](http://blog.springsource.com/2010/07/22/spring-mvc-3-showcase/) and was adapted into a SpringOne presentation called [Mastering MVC 3](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Mastering-Spring-MVC-3).

A screen cast showing the showcase in action is [available in QuickTime format](http://s3.springsource.org/MVC/mvc-showcase-screencast.mov).
